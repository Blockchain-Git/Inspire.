Hey! Thanks SO much for following.

Do you have any software that's open source?
What's your "Business Model"?? Do you guys have any plugin that works Natively with blockchains? like Filecoin protocols:

I'm a developer, & CTO.. I've been on every Git SaaS host all the way from the "http://Unfuddle.com" days. 

Currently spread across:
- GitHub (free & enterprise)
- GitLab
- Bitbucket
- Git Gogs
- local

And I was building a backup & sync system similar to yours #NoNeed but to Azure Cold Storage & on prem Tape & Erasure coded Ceph.

Will talk to our CEO about getting your product.

Currently there's a LOT of pain points in the Git ecosystem. mostly due to segmentation & fragmentation of the paid SaaS service space. (Remember when GitLab Community went "semi Closed source" and took out features?)

Would you guys be interested in talking about a Joint Venture? on the Blockchain backup front?

If we get blockchain backups to Five nines then Ceph goes away, and On Prem gets A LOT simpler & cheaper. Requiring just LTO Tape (for regulatory compliance as well as sanity). Most restores come directly from a blockchain storage cloud.

Then customers have more money to spend on Software licenses.
